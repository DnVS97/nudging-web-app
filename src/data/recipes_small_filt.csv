This is a simple scalloped potato recipe.  Everyone has their own way of preparing them, and I guess some people will like it and some won't, but this method is very similar to the way I make them.  The original directions gave the crockpot cooking method as the preferred method, with oven baking as an option.  I have reversed this option, since I don't do much cooking in the crockpot.  I hate to leave any electric appliance on when no one is at home.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picKlg7Uh.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picmDH8PY.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picH4phGr.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picEtXOFk.jpg"")",Potato,"c(""Cheese"", ""Vegetable"", ""Healthy"", ""Weeknight"", ""Oven"", ""< 4 Hours"")","c(""5"", ""1/4"", ""1 1/2"", ""1 1/2"", ""1/2"", NA, NA)","c(""potatoes"", ""flour"", ""half-and-half"", ""cheddar cheese"", ""parmesan cheese"", ""paprika"")",4.0,25.0,332.0,10.5,6.5,32.3,260.7,46.0,5.2,4.3,14.2,,,"c(""Layer potatoes, flour, milk, and salt and pepper (if desired) in a large casserole dish in several layers, then top with cheeses and paprika."", ""Bake at 350°F for 1 1/2 hours."", ""Optional crockpot method:  Spray crock pot with non-stick spray.
